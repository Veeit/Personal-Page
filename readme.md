# Veit Progl Webpage

this is the personal webpage from Veit Progl. It is build with basic html and css. I added express.js and nodemon just as a development envoriment for a easy to use and portable webserver (that autoreloads).

I have not used gatsby, React or vue on this project because it is not necessary. With simple html and css I can guarantee that this site is as simple as possible without any js overhead. This leads to much smaller file sizes and loading speeds. Perfect for a personal website!
